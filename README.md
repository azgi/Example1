# Example1
Using a directory already under version control
If you have an existing directory which is already under Git or Subversion version control then you simply need to create a new RStudio project for that directory and then version control features will be automatically enabled. To do this:

Execute the New Project command (from the Project menu)
Choose to create a new project from an Existing Directory
Select the appropriate directory and then click Create Project
A new project will be created for the directory and RStudio's version control features will then be available for that directory.
